The Filecache library/tool is designed to manage files used in production by keeping a deduplicated cache of file chunks used to create a file or files, and a database of files to chunks relationships.

Note: This is extremely early in development. There's plenty left to do before this is stable enough to move out of early development.

- [ ] Add client support
- [ ] Add database support to map files to chunks
- [ ] Add server support
- [ ] Add server and client communication support (with authentication?)
- [ ] Add a C API
- [ ] Add automated testing
- [ ] Add API and user documentation
- [ ] Add license (Assume Apache2 for now)
